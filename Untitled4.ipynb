    "Abstraction is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they exhibit. It is the process of hiding the unnecessary details of an object and showing only the relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction allows you to focus on the essential characteristics of an object while ignoring the non-essential details. This helps in managing complexity and organizing code in a way that makes it more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a real-world scenario of a car. A car can be abstracted as an object with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Some relevant properties of a car might include its make, model, color, and speed. Relevant behaviors could include starting the engine, accelerating, braking, and turning.\n",

    "In this example, we've abstracted the concept of a car into a class (`Car`). The class has properties (make, model, color, speed) and methods (start_engine, accelerate, brake) that represent the essential characteristics and behaviors of a car. When interacting with the car object, we don't need to worry about the internal details of how the engine starts or how acceleration is implemented; we can simply use the provided methods to perform actions on the car.

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two distinct but closely related concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Let's differentiate between them and provide an example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors, while hiding the unnecessary details.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** It allows you to focus on the high-level representation of an object, emphasizing what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In the previous answer, the example of a `Car` class demonstrated abstraction. The `Car` class abstracts the essential properties (make, model, color) and behaviors (start_engine, accelerate, brake) of a car. Users of the class interact with these high-level properties and methods without needing to understand the internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It involves restricting access to some of an object's components, promoting the idea of hiding the internal details.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** It helps in organizing and structuring code, as well as preventing direct access to an object's internal state from outside the class. This promotes data integrity and reduces the likelihood of unintended interference or modification.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class BankAccount:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "             self._account_number = account_number  # Encapsulation: attribute with an underscore\n",
    "             self._balance = balance  # Encapsulation: attribute with an underscore\n",
    "\n",
    "         def get_balance(self):\n",
    "             return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "         def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "             if amount > 0:\n",
    "                 self._balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "         def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "             if 0 < amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "                 self._balance -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Usage of encapsulation\n",
    "     account = BankAccount(account_number=\"123456\", balance=1000)\n",
    "     current_balance = account.get_balance()\n",
    "     account.deposit(500)\n",
    "     account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     In this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account number (`_account_number`) and balance (`_balance`) attributes. Direct access to these attributes from outside the class is discouraged, and instead, methods like `get_balance`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` are provided for interacting with the object. This encapsulation helps maintain the integrity of the object's state and behavior. The use of underscores in attribute names (`_account_number` and `_balance`) conventionally indicates that they are intended for internal use within the class."

    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes,\" and it provides a mechanism for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) and abstract methods. Abstract base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as a blueprint for other classes. The `abc` module is used to enforce a structure on derived classes, ensuring that they implement specific methods or properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the `abc` module include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ABC (Abstract Base Class):** The `ABC` class in the `abc` module is a metaclass that can be used as a base class for creating abstract base classes. You can subclass `ABC` to define your own abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **@abstractmethod decorator:** The `abc` module provides the `@abstractmethod` decorator, which is used to declare abstract methods within an abstract base class. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reasons for using the `abc` module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enforcing Interface:** It allows you to define a common interface for a group of related classes. This ensures that subclasses adhere to a specific structure, making it easier to reason about the code and ensuring a consistent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Abstract base classes support polymorphism by allowing different classes to implement the same interface. This makes it possible to write code that can work with objects of various classes as long as they conform to the expected interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Organization:** Using abstract base classes helps in organizing code by grouping together related classes and defining a clear hierarchy. It encourages the separation of concerns and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Abstract base classes serve as a form of documentation, indicating to developers which methods must be implemented by subclasses. This can improve code readability and help prevent common programming errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example illustrating the use of the `abc` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract base class using ABC\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",

    "# Concrete subclass implementing the abstract methods\n",
    "class Square(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side_length):\n",
    "        self.side_length = side_length\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side_length ** 2\n",
    "\n",

    "# Using the implemented methods\n",
    "print(\"Area:\", square.area())          # Output: 25\n",
    "print(\"Perimeter:\", square.perimeter()) # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape` class is an abstract base class with abstract methods `area` and `perimeter`. The `Square` class is a concrete subclass that provides implementations for these abstract methods. The use of the `abc` module ensures that any class deriving from `Shape` must implement the specified methods, promoting a consistent structure across related classes."

    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the concept of hiding the implementation details of data and exposing only the essential features or properties. In object-oriented programming (OOP), data abstraction is typically achieved through the use of classes and interfaces. Here are the key steps to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Class:**\n",
    "   - Create a class that represents the abstract concept or entity you want to model.\n",
    "   - Include attributes (data members) that encapsulate the state of the object.\n",
    "   - Define methods (member functions) that encapsulate the behavior or operations related to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "            self.make = make\n",
    "            self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "        def start_engine(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Engine started.\")\n",

    "            print(\"Car is in motion.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hide Implementation Details:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulate the implementation details within the class, making internal data (attributes) private or protected.\n",
    "   - Use access modifiers like private attributes (prefixed with a single underscore `_`) to indicate that they are not intended for external access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "            self._make = make  # private attribute\n",
    "            self._model = model  # private attribute\n",

    "            print(\"Car is in motion.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide a Public Interface:**\n",
    "   - Expose a public interface consisting of methods that allow external code to interact with the object.\n",
    "   - This public interface represents the essential features of the object and hides the internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "            self._make = make\n",
    "            self._model = model\n",
    "\n",

    "            print(\"Car is in motion.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Getter and Setter Methods:**\n",
    "   - If necessary, provide getter and setter methods to allow controlled access to private attributes.\n",
    "   - This allows external code to read or modify the internal state in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "            self._make = make\n",
    "            self._model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "        def start_engine(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Engine started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        def drive(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Car is in motion.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        def get_make(self):\n",
    "            return self._make\n",
    "\n",
    "        def set_make(self, make):\n",
    "            self._make = make\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you achieve data abstraction as the internal details of the object (such as the structure of attributes and the implementation of methods) are hidden, and external code interacts with the object through a well-defined public interface. This promotes modularity, code organization, and the ability to change the internal implementation without affecting the external code that uses the object."
