    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, an exception object is created and the normal execution of the program is interrupted. Python provides a built-in mechanism to handle these exceptions, allowing you to catch and handle them gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed. Syntax errors are caused by invalid Python syntax, such as missing parentheses or using incorrect keywords, and they prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully recover from the exceptional condition. On the other hand, syntax errors cannot be caught or handled within the program because they prevent the program from running in the first place. You need to fix the syntax error before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Types: Exceptions come in various types, such as ValueError, TypeError, and FileNotFoundError, among others. Each exception type represents a specific type of error that can occur during program execution. Syntax errors, on the other hand, do not have different types. They are simply flagged as syntax errors by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cause: Exceptions are typically caused by runtime conditions, such as invalid user input or problems with external resources like files or networks. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are caused by mistakes in the structure of the program's code itself, such as misspelled keywords or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during the execution of a program and can be caught and handled, while syntax errors are detected before the program is executed and need to be fixed before running the program. Exceptions are caused by runtime conditions and come in different types, while syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the program's code structure."
