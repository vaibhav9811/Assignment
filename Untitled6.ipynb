    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating individual instances of objects, which are referred to as objects or instances of the class.\n",

    "In this example, we define a `Car` class with attributes such as `brand`, `model`, and `color`, and methods such as `start_engine()` and `drive()`. The `__init__()` method is a special method called the constructor, which is executed when a new object is created. It initializes the attributes of the object with the values provided during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create two instances of the `Car` class, `car1` and `car2`, with different attribute values. These instances are objects of the `Car` class and represent specific cars with their unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the attributes of the objects using dot notation, such as `car1.brand` and `car2.model`. This allows us to retrieve the values associated with the respective attributes of each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can invoke the methods defined in the class using dot notation, such as `car1.start_engine()` and `car2.drive()`. This triggers the execution of the respective methods for each object.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal details and implementation of an object and exposing only the necessary information or interfaces. It allows for bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class, providing data abstraction and access control. Encapsulation helps in achieving data security, code reusability, and modular programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of a new class (derived class) based on an existing class (base class). The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, allowing for code reuse and extending the functionality of the base class. Inheritance promotes code reusability, modularity, and hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means having multiple forms or behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or respond differently based on the context. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a different implementation of a method already defined in the base class, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling them at a higher level of abstraction. It involves representing only the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows for focusing on the essential characteristics of an object, promoting modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—provide a solid foundation for designing and implementing robust, modular, and maintainable software systems. They help in organizing code, managing complexity, and promoting code reusability, making object-oriented programming a powerful paradigm for software development."

    "The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is commonly known as the constructor method, as it initializes the attributes or properties of the object. The primary purpose of the `__init__()` function is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "# Accessing object attributes and invoking methods\n",
    "person1.display_info()\n",
    "person2.display_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a `Person` class with attributes such as `name` and `age`. The `__init__()` method is defined with two parameters, `name` and `age`, which represent the initial values of the corresponding attributes. Inside the `__init__()` method, these parameters are used to assign values to the attributes of the object using the `self` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create objects of the `Person` class, such as `person1` and `person2`, the `__init__()` method is automatically invoked, and the provided arguments are passed to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then access the attributes of the objects using dot notation, such as `person1.name` and `person2.age`. This allows us to retrieve the values associated with the respective attributes of each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can invoke the `display_info()` method defined in the class using dot notation, such as `person1.display_info()` and `person2.display_info()`. This method prints the values of the object's attributes, providing information about the person's name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function is essential in OOP as it ensures that the attributes of an object are properly initialized when the object is created. It allows us to specify the initial state of an object and provide necessary data or parameters during object instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `__init__()` function, we can encapsulate the initialization logic within the class, making the creation of objects more streamlined and intuitive. It helps in maintaining the integrity and consistency of objects by ensuring that they are properly initialized before they are used in the program."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a conventionally used parameter name that represents the instance of a class. It is a reference to the current object being operated upon or accessed within a class method. The use of `self` allows for accessing the attributes and invoking the methods of the object within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Object Reference: In OOP, methods are defined within a class and operate on objects of that class. The `self` parameter acts as a reference to the specific instance of the class (object) on which the method is being invoked. It allows the method to access and manipulate the object's attributes and invoke its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attribute Access: By using `self`, you can access the object's attributes and modify them within the class methods. It allows for reading or updating the state of the object's attributes throughout the class's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method Invocation: `self` enables the invocation of other methods within the class. By using `self.method_name()`, you can call other methods defined in the class, allowing for reusability and modular code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiple Instances: In OOP, you can create multiple instances (objects) of a class. Each instance has its own set of attributes and state. The `self` parameter allows different objects to maintain their individual state and data, as it refers to the specific instance on which the method is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate the use of `self` in accessing attributes and invoking methods within a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",

    "# Creating an object of the Circle class\n",
    "circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing object attributes and invoking methods using self\n",
    "circle.display_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Circle` class has an `__init__()` method that initializes the `radius` attribute of the object using the `self` parameter. The `calculate_area()` method calculates the area of the circle using the `self.radius` attribute. The `display_info()` method displays information about the circle, including its radius and calculated area.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `self`, the methods can access and manipulate the object's attributes (`self.radius`) and invoke other methods (`self.calculate_area()`) within the class.\n",

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows for creating new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). It enables the derived classes to inherit the attributes and methods of the base classes, promoting code reuse and facilitating the organization and extension of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance in OOP, each serving a specific purpose. The common types of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance: Single inheritance is a type of inheritance where a derived class inherits from a single base class. It forms a parent-child relationship between the classes. In single inheritance, the derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Driving the vehicle.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
    "car.start_engine()\n",
    "car.drive()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Vehicle` class is the base class, and the `Car` class is the derived class. The `Car` class inherits the `brand` attribute and the `drive()` method from the `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class also defines its own method `start_engine()`. The object `car` of the `Car` class can access and use both the inherited method `drive()` and the class-specific method `start_engine()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a derived class can inherit from multiple base classes. It allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes, forming a hierarchy of parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mammal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, sound):\n",
    "        self.sound = sound\n",
    "\n",
    "    def walk(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal, Mammal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def walk(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog is walking.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog.speak()\n",
    "dog.walk()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from both the `Animal` class and the `Mammal` class using multiple inheritance. The `Dog` class inherits the `name` attribute from the `Animal` class and the `sound` attribute from the `Mammal` class. It also overrides the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class and the `walk()` method from the `Mammal` class. The object `dog` of the `Dog` class can access and use attributes and methods from both the `Animal` class and the `Mammal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance: Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance where a derived class inherits from another derived class. It forms a chain of inheritance, allowing for the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

    "        print(f\"The shape's color is {self.color}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius, color):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "class FilledCircle(Circle):\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        self.display_color()\n",
    "        print(f\"The circle's area is {self.calculate_area()}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "filled_circle = FilledCircle(5, \"Red\")\n",
    "filled_circle.display_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "` class is the base class, the `Circle` class is the derived class from `Shape`, and the `FilledCircle` class is the derived class from `Circle`. The `FilledCircle` class inherits the `color` attribute from the `Shape` class and the `radius` attribute from the `Circle` class. It also inherits the `display_color()` method from the `Shape` class and the `calculate_area()` method from the `Circle` class. The `FilledCircle` class defines its own method `display_info()`. The object `filled_circle` of the `FilledCircle` class can access and use attributes and methods from all the inherited classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate different types of inheritance in OOP—single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance. Each type of inheritance allows for code reuse, modularity, and the organization of classes in a hierarchical structure. It enhances the flexibility and extensibility of the code by enabling the derived classes to inherit and build upon the attributes and methods of the base classes."
