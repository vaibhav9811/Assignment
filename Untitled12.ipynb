    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information. It serves as a central repository for various types of data, making it easy to store, manage, and access information for different applications and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structure: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases, which means they store data in structured tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "2. Schema: They have a fixed schema, which means the data must adhere to a specific structure defined during database design.\n",
    "3. Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity rules, such as foreign key constraints and unique constraints, to maintain data consistency.\n",
    "4. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and managing data. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with the database, making it easy to perform complex queries and joins.\n",
    "5. Scalability: Traditional SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means they require more powerful hardware to handle increased workload.\n",
    "6. Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex relationships between entities, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise-level applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structure: NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not strictly adhere to the rigid tabular structure of SQL databases. They offer more flexibility in data representation.\n",
    "2. Schema: NoSQL databases are often schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing developers to store different types of data without a predefined structure.\n",
    "3. Data Integrity: NoSQL databases may sacrifice some data integrity constraints in favor of higher flexibility and performance.\n",
    "4. Query Language: NoSQL databases typically use non-SQL query languages or APIs specific to the database type. The querying capabilities can vary depending on the NoSQL database chosen.\n",
    "5. Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means they can handle increased traffic by adding more servers to the database cluster, making them highly scalable for large-scale applications and big data.\n",
    "6. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media platforms, real-time analytics, IoT (Internet of Things) applications, and content management systems."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, manage, and modify the structure of the database and its objects. DDL commands are used to create, alter, and drop database objects like tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL statements do not manipulate data; instead, they focus on defining the database's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain the four main DDL commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects. One of the most common uses of CREATE is to create tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a simple table named \"employees\" to store employee information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    emp_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    emp_department VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a table called \"employees\" with columns \"emp_id,\" \"emp_name,\" \"emp_department,\" and \"emp_salary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "The DROP command is used to remove database objects, such as tables or indexes. Be cautious when using DROP, as it permanently deletes the specified object and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "To drop the \"employees\" table we created earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will delete the \"employees\" table and all its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns in a table, change data types, or rename objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to add a new column \"emp_location\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD emp_location VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command adds a new column \"emp_location\" to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the rows from a table, effectively deleting all the data, but the table structure remains intact. Unlike DROP, TRUNCATE does not delete the table; it only removes its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "To remove all records from the \"employees\" table while keeping its structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's explain the three main DML commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT command is used to add new rows (records) into a table, providing the values for each column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a table named \"students\" with columns \"student_id,\" \"student_name,\" and \"age,\" and we want to insert a new student's record:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name, age)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are inserting a new row into the \"students\" table with the specified values for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE command is used to modify existing records in a table by changing the values of one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say we want to update the age of the student with \"student_id\" 1 to 21:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE students\n",
    "SET age = 21\n",
    "WHERE student_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will locate the row in the \"students\" table with \"student_id\" equal to 1 and update the \"age\" column to 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE command is used to remove one or more rows (records) from a table based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to delete the student record with \"student_id\" 2 from the \"students\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM students\n",
    "WHERE student_id = 2;\n",

    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that define relationships between tables and help maintain data integrity. Let's explain each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key:\n",
    "A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each row in a database table. It uniquely identifies each record in the table and ensures that there are no duplicate rows. Primary keys play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and structure of a database. The main characteristics of a primary key are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique for each row in the table.\n",
    "- Non-null: The primary key column must not contain any null (empty) values.\n",
    "- Fixed: The primary key value should not change over time or should be minimally mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"students\" with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| student_id | first_name | last_name | age | major       |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-----------|-----|------------|\n",
    "| 1          | John       | Doe       | 20  | Mathematics |\n",
    "| 2          | Jane       | Smith     | 21  | Physics     |\n",
    "| 3          | Mike       | Johnson   | 19  | Chemistry   |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, \"student_id\" is the primary key since it uniquely identifies each student. No two rows can have the same \"student_id.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a field or a set of fields in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables, representing a relationship between the data in those tables. The primary purpose of foreign keys is to maintain referential integrity, which means that the data in the related tables remain consistent and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"courses\" with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| course_id | course_name     | instructor   |\n",
    "|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| 101        | Math 101        | Professor A  |\n",
    "| 102        | Physics 101     | Professor B  |\n",
    "| 103        | Chemistry 101   | Professor C  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we have another table named \"enrollments\" for recording student enrollments in courses:\n",
    "\n",
    "| enrollment_id | student_id | course_id | grade |\n",
    "|---------------|------------|-----------|-------|\n",
    "| 1             | 1          | 101       | A     |\n",
    "| 2             | 2          | 102       | B     |\n",
    "| 3             | 3          | 101       | B+    |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"enrollments\" table, both \"student_id\" and \"course_id\" are foreign keys since they refer to the Primary Keys of the \"students\" and \"courses\" tables, respectively. These foreign keys maintain the relationship between the tables and ensure that the data remains consistent, preventing the creation of invalid relationships between students and courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Primary Keys uniquely identify records in a table, while Foreign Keys establish relationships between tables in a relational database. Together, they help maintain data integrity and structure within the database."

    "\n",
    "1. `cursor()` method:\n",
    "The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object that allows you to interact with the database. A cursor acts as a pointer to the result set returned by a query. It provides methods to execute SQL statements and retrieve data from the database. The cursor object is created using the `cursor()` method of the connection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `execute()` method:\n",
    "The `execute()` method is used to execute an SQL query or statement. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and sends it to the database for execution. If the query is a SELECT statement, the result set will be returned to the cursor, and you can fetch the data from it. For other types of queries (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), the `execute()` method will perform the corresponding action on the database.\n",
